# Ascend Attention Optimization

Qwen3.8-27B, 4 x Ascend 910A first generation (`Short_SoC_version=Ascend910`), TP=4, CANN 9.0.0.

This document records what was changed, what was measured, and what the measurements rule out.
Every number below comes from a run on the machine described above; the command that produced it is
named in the same section. Where a figure is an inference rather than a measurement, it is labelled
as one.

## 1. Why the attention kernel had to be rewritten

The original full-attention kernel computed every `Q * K^T` dot product on the **Vector** unit, as a
scalar loop over positions with an element-wise multiply plus a fold reduction inside. The Cube
(matrix) unit sat idle during both attention products.

For Qwen3.8-27B the ratio makes this indefensible:

- attention is **0.2% of the arithmetic** in a prefill (the feed-forward and projection GEMMs
  dominate the FLOP count), but it is not 0.2% of the time;
- 16 of the 64 layers are full attention; the other 48 are gated-delta linear attention.

Moving both products onto the Cube is therefore not a throughput play, it is the removal of a scalar
loop that has no business being on the vector unit at all.

## 2. The Cube (Mmad) kernel

`cpp_engine/backends/ascend/kernels/qwen_attention_cube_f16.cpp`.

Three passes per work item, with the vector unit left the softmax:

1. **`S = Q * K^T`** — Q and K staged GM -> L1 as ND, converted to NZ, one `Mmad` into L0C, read out
   to UB in fp16, scaled, written back to GM through `Nz2Nd`.
2. **Softmax per query row** — max, exp, sum and division on a row-major fp32 row. The row is written
   back as the already-normalised fp16 probability row, so pass 3 needs no post-division.
3. **`O += P * V`** — P and `V^T` staged, accumulated across chunks **in L0C itself**, then read out
   and stored.

One work item is a whole `(query head group, position tile)` pair, not a single head. K and V do not
depend on which query head asks for them, so a per-head item re-reads the entire K cache once per
head — a factor of `repeat` more traffic than the arithmetic requires, on a part where attention is
bandwidth-bound rather than Cube-bound. Stacking the head group as extra rows of the same `Mmad`
costs nothing and keeps the A operand one contiguous block.

The GM round trip through the score scratch is deliberate: L0C leaves the Cube in a zN fractal image,
and every row-wise reduction on that image is a gather across 16-element fractals. `Nz2Nd` only
writes to GM on this SoC. For `d = 256` the round trip is 2 bytes per score in and 2 bytes back out
against 64 MACs per score, so the arithmetic intensity absorbs it.

First-generation 910 specifics the kernel depends on, each of which cost a debugging round:

- no `MMAD` bias operand, so nothing asks for one;
- no fp32 `WholeReduceMax`, hence the vmax halving fold;
- L0C -> UB only through `DataCopy` under `BLOCK_MODE_MATRIX`, sized in KB of the **fp32 source**
  rather than of the fp16 destination.

Two entries exist because the call shapes genuinely differ: `causal != 0` for prefill (rows are
sequence positions with individual causal limits) and `causal == 0` for decode (a single position, so
the tile is the whole query head group and every row shares one limit).

### 2.1 The tile pitch: two wrong strides, and why no test saw them

As first committed, the prefill entry read Q and wrote O with the *position* pitch
(`q_heads * head_dim`) where the tile's own row pitch (`head_dim`) belongs. One work item stacks a
whole head group at one position — `q_base = (row0 * q_heads + kv_head * repeat) * head_dim` — so
its rows are adjacent in GM, and `q_heads * head_dim` is the distance to the *next position*:

- `Nd2NzParams::srcDValue = q_pitch` read rows 1..`repeat-1` of Q from five positions further along
  than intended (row 0 is correct, since `0 * q_pitch == 0`);
- `Nz2NdParamsFull::dstDStride = q_pitch` sent tile row `s` to GM offset `s * q_heads * head_dim`, so
  only `ceil(rows / q_heads)` of `rows` rows landed inside the output buffer and the remainder ran
  past the end of the allocation.

At TP4 (`q_heads=6`, `kv_heads=1`, `head_dim=256`) that is five of six head rows wrong on both the
read and the write. Both are now `head_dim`, and the kernel refuses `kv_heads != 1`, which is the
condition under which a single pitch describes both the group and the output (see the note above).

Both tests that should have caught it shared a defect of their own: each had a `float_to_half` that
never packed the exponent. Every value in the uniform range these files generate is in `(-1, 1)`, so
every input became a denormal near `2^-24`, every output landed three orders of magnitude below the
`4e-3` tolerance, and the comparison passed on zeros. `test_qwen_ascend_cube_attention` reported `ok`
for a kernel writing five of six heads into the wrong memory. With the exponent packed, the same test
immediately reported `cube max_abs=6.4e-01 bad=91458/98304 head-rows diverging=383/384`, and the
repeat probe — which compares the Cube path against the vector path on the same input — reported row
0 identical and every later row different, which is the signature of a per-position pitch error.

After both fixes `test_qwen_ascend_cube_attention` reports `ok` at every length from 16 to 2048 and at
decode contexts 512/1024/4096, with Cube `max_abs` `3.1e-04`..`3.5e-04` against a double reference. A
throwaway probe (a seeded destination rather than a cleared one, so an unwritten element is visible)
confirmed independently that every output row is now fully written, that no head rows diverge, and
that the Cube path differs from the vector path by one fp16 ulp (`2.44e-04`); it is not kept in the
tree.

**Throughput is unchanged**, which is the expected result: the defect put the same bytes on the wire,
just at the wrong addresses. 512/128 prefill moved 428.1 -> 415.8 TPS and 4096/32 moved 1265.3 ->
1262.8 TPS (decode 9.21 -> 8.83 and 9.55 -> 8.82), all inside run-to-run spread.

## 3. Measured decode attention

Same machine, 4097-token context, `bench_qwen_ascend_attention`. Three kernels are dispatchable and
the winner is not the one with the most cores:

| kernel | time | relative |
|---|---|---|
| Cube, context-split | **257 us** | 1.0x |
| Cube, single core | 1225 us | 4.8x slower |
| FlashDecoding (vector, split) | 5224 us | 20.3x slower |

The split-Cube path wins because the single-core Cube kernel leaves 29 of 30 cores idle while
streaming the same K/V, and FlashDecoding drives its per-head partial and reduce state through
scalar `GetValue`/`SetValue` loops.

Dispatch (`cpp_engine/engine/qwen_layer_components.inl`): split Cube when the shape is expressible
and `context_length > 512`; single-core Cube below that, where there is nothing to split; the
FlashDecoding path is kept only for shapes the Cube path refuses. It is not a preference — it is a
fallback.

## 4. Measured prefill attribution

`QWEN_HOST_PROFILE=1`, 64 layers, 512-token prompt, `--resident-bench`. The profile emits three
blocks (kernel warmup, the real prefill, decode) and the per-phase cost is the difference between
block 0 and block 1. Prefill wall for the differenced pair: **1.6742 s**.

| phase | seconds | calls | us/call | share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STACK.r` (whole decoder layer) | 1.1031 | 64 | 17236 | **65.9%** |
| `full_attention` | 0.1646 | 32 | 5144 | 9.8% |
| `STACK.d` | 0.0967 | 64 | 1512 | 5.8% |
| `top1_allreduce` | 0.0814 | 2 | 40688 | 4.9% |
| `tp_all_reduce` | 0.0779 | 130 | 599 | 4.6% |
| every `pr.*` / `pd.*` projection | ~0.050 | — | — | ~3% |

Two conclusions this settles:

- **All projection GEMMs together are ~3% of prefill.** The prefill gap is not in the matmuls, so
  further GEMM tuning cannot close it.
- **`STACK.r` at 17.2 ms/layer is 66% of prefill and is still an unattributed black box.** It wraps
  `decoder_layer_component.forward(...)` as a single scope, so it absorbs the layer's norms, transposes,
  gated-delta work and elementwise passes without naming any of them. Instrumenting inside it is the
  next measurement, and it is a prerequisite for any further prefill work — attributing this to
  "attention" would be wrong, since `full_attention` is measured separately and is 9.8%.

## 5. Measured throughput

All runs: four ranks, `--smoke-forward --resident-bench`, `tp-world 4`, 64 layers unless noted. `POCKETLLM_CPP_NCCL_ID_WAIT_ATTEMPTS=12000`, `HCCL_WHITELIST_DISABLE=1`.

| configuration | prompt | new | prefill TPS | decode TPS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| before startup kernel warmup | 512 | 128 | 234.3 | 9.38 |
| after startup kernel warmup | 512 | 128 | **428.1** | 9.21 |
| after startup kernel warmup | 4096 | 32 | **1265.3** | 9.55 |
| 64-layer reference, Cube split decode | 512 | 5 | 435.6 | 9.23 |
| 4096 prefill, prior to this branch | 4096 | 1-16 | 287-325 | 3.20 |

The startup-warmup fix (`QwenEngine::warmup_kernels`) brackets exactly one full forward pass with
8-row prefill and one decode step. It is worth 512/128: 2.185 s -> 1.196 s (**1.83x** prefill) and
4096/32: 965.9 -> 1265.3 TPS. Without it the first measured step pays the aclnn kernel-selection and
`aclrtMemcpy` warmup cost, which on this part lands outside the measured region. It is a fix to
*measurement validity* as much as to speed: before it, run-to-run prefill varied by 1.8x on identical
input.

### Decode scaling with layer count

| layers | decode TPS | ms/step |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 105.7 | 9.5 |
| 4 | 67.2 | 14.9 |
| 8 | 58.8 | 17.0 |
| 16 | 33.5 | 29.9 |
| 32 | 18.1 | 55.4 |
| 64 | 9.24 | 108.2 |

A linear fit gives **~7.8 ms fixed per step + ~1.63 ms per layer**. That fixed term is why a 1-layer
run at 105 TPS says nothing about the 64-layer model, and it is worth stating explicitly because it
is easy to misread a short-layer smoke run as a solved decode target.

## 6. Measured hardware ceilings

`bench_qwen_ascend_gemm --scan` (single token row against a growing weight matrix):

| weight size | GB/s |
|---|---|
| 15 MB | ~356 |
| 60 MB | ~300 |
| 240 MB | ~290 |
| 960 MB | ~276 |
| 3840 MB | ~320 |

The rate is **flat over a 256x weight-size range**, so a single-row GEMV has no amortisable per-call
overhead: ~320 GB/s is this access pattern's rate, not a launch-cost artefact. That the 15 MB case
(fully L2-resident, 32 MB L2) is no faster than the 3840 MB case is the strongest evidence that the
limit is not HBM capacity traffic.

It is not the hardware's rate either. The scan only covers **M=1**, and M=1 is the shape the Cube
cannot fill: the unit is 16 rows tall, so a one-row `Mmad` leaves fifteen sixteenths of every tile
idle. Re-run on the current tree at `--iters 20`, 5 and 50, the plateau holds (15/60/240/960/3840 MB
-> 285.5/355.7/333.4/315.0/322.2 GB/s at 20 iterations; the 15 MB point is the noisy one, reading
215.2 to 303.2 GB/s across iteration counts, and never faster than the large cases). Widening the
batch is what the hardware was waiting for, and it is 75% faster at M=16 — see
[ascend_decode_collective_ab.md](ascend_decode_collective_ab.md) §6.2 for the M sweep, and the HBM
read probe below for the same point from the other side.

`bench_qwen_ascend_gemm --mem`, 512 MB D2D `aclrtMemcpy`: **8.7 GB/s**, i.e. **37x slower than the
GEMV**. Two consequences: any hot path using this copy is unaffordable, and this probe must not be
used to estimate HBM bandwidth.

`bench_qwen_ascend_allreduce`, HCCL f16 all-reduce, one process per rank:

| payload | time |
|---|---|
| 10 KB | 0.3923 ms |
| 640 KB | 0.3989 ms |
| 40 MB | 3.2064 ms |

Flat from 10 KB to 640 KB, against a device-op floor of 0.0183 ms. It is a pure **latency** wall, so
the fix is fewer collectives, not a faster collective. TP4 is the sweet spot (TP2 0.4554 ms, TP8
0.5156 ms at 10 KB).

That table prices the internal-stream call, which is **not** the one the engine executes.
`QWEN_NCCL_COMM_STREAM` defaults on, so every collective is bracketed by `begin_nccl_collective` /
`end_nccl_collective` and issued on the communication stream. `bench_qwen_ascend_allreduce`'s `comm`
variant reproduces exactly that sequence, and measures **0.4430 ms at 10 KB** on rank 0 — 0.4438,
0.4429 and 0.4436 ms on ranks 1-3, a spread under 0.2%. It is also flat in payload, like `sync`. That
is the per-call price the decode step pays: **129 calls x 0.4430 ms = 57.1 ms**, not the 50.6 ms the
`sync` row implies.

### Decode is not at the bandwidth ceiling

Per-rank resident weights, from the engine's own startup line: `resident_weight_bytes=13449011456` =
**13.45 GB**. Every linear is read once per token, so at the measured 320 GB/s streaming rate the hard
floor is **42.0 ms/token = 23.8 TPS at TP4** (21.0 ms -> 47.6 TPS at TP8), before any collective cost.

Measured decode is **9.2 TPS** = 108.6 ms/token, i.e. 13.45 GB / 108.6 ms = **124 GB/s effective**,
about 40% of what the standalone GEMV achieves. So there are two separate deficits, and both must be
named:

- the per-layer cost is ~2.4x the pure weight-streaming cost, because `STACK.d` also carries the
  gated-delta matrix work (two 128x128 reductions and a rank-1 update currently done as 128-wide
  vector ops, with `broadcast_rows` the documented hot spot), the norms, and the transposes;
- 129 TP all-reduce calls per decode token (64 `ar.mlp` + 48 `ar.lin.out` + 16 `ar.full.out` +
  1 `ar.hidden_a`) at the measured 0.4430 ms each — flat in payload, so per-call and not per-byte —
  serialised by the per-call `stream_synchronize` inside `end_nccl_collective`. That is **57.1 ms** of
  the 108.6 ms step. (Two earlier revisions of this page and of the roadmap priced the same calls at
  ~540 us each and at 0.3923 ms; the latter is the bench's `sync` row, and neither is the path the
  engine runs.)

**100 TPS is not reachable on this part at fp16.** It needs <= 10 ms/token; the perfect-streaming
bound at TP8 is 21 ms with zero collective cost, which would already require 673 GB/s per card.
Reaching the target requires weight quantization — int8 for 2x, int4 for 4x — plus removing the
per-step collective serialisation. Note also that 8 cards is the practical maximum here:
`HcclCommInitAll` is unusable on this stack and one process per rank is required.

## 7. What this rules out

- **More GEMM tuning for prefill.** Projections are ~3% of prefill.
- **Blaming prefill on attention.** `full_attention` is 9.8% at 512 tokens and is measured separately
  from `STACK.r`; attributing the 66% to it would point the next optimisation at the wrong unit.
- **A faster collective.** The HCCL floor is flat in payload size up to 640 KB.
- **`aclrtMemcpy`-based bandwidth work.** 8.7 GB/s.
- **Reading the M=1 GEMV plateau as the hardware ceiling.** It is the rate of a shape the Cube cannot
  fill. The same matmul measures 248.6 GB/s at M=1 and 435.8 GB/s at M=16 (`matmul Mx5120x4352`,
  `bench_qwen_ascend_decode_ops`), against an HBM read probe of 1148 GB/s.
- **Reading a short-layer smoke run as decode throughput.** See the layer scaling table.
